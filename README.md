# pyTEMlib

pyTEMlib is a package to read and process various kind of data acquired with a (scanning) transmission electron microscope.

The package is written in pure python and depends on various other libraries.

All data, user input, and results are stored as [pyNSID-type](https://github.com/pycroscopy/pyNSID) files.

The data are all presented as [sidpy-datasets](https://github.com/pycroscopy/sidpy) 

I have uploaded a version to pypi which you can install with:

 python3 -m pip install  pyTEMlib 
 
 This command is also available in the example notebooks
