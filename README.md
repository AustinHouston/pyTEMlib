# pyTEMlib

pyTEMlib is a package to read and process various kind of data acquired with a (scanning) transmission electron microscope (STEM).

The package is written in pure python and depends on various other libraries.

All data, user input, and results are stored as [NSID-formatted](https://pycroscopy.github.io/pyNSID/nsid.html) HDF5 files.

The data are all presented as [sidpy.Dataset](https://pycroscopy.github.io/sidpy/notebooks/00_basic_usage/create_dataset.html) objects

Install pyTEMlib via pip as:

``python3 -m pip install  pyTEMlib``
 
This command is also built into the [example notebooks](https://github.com/pycroscopy/pyTEMlib/notebooks)
